### Outline of my readings

Properties of Real Numbers:
    - Field Axioms
    - Ordered Set
    - Ordered Field
    - Completeness Property
        - Unique to Reals and not the Rationals
    - Archimedean Property, Q dense in R
        - Unique
    - Uniqueness of the set of real numbers

### Notes I'd like to make

1. Modelling continuous phenomena
    - A big reason for the study of sequences and their limits was to be able to define continuous processes with something discrete (sequences being elements indexed by natural numbers)
    - Discussing where intuitive processes that make sense for discrete scenarios (finite or countably infinite sets) break down when discussing continuous scenarios
    - Examples of paradoxes like Zeno's and how definite notions of the limits of sequences would resolve those are crucial
    - Almost every process in calculus involves some sort of a limiting/continuous process which sequences are made a lot more easier to talk about when using the language of sequences
        - Definitions of real numbers as equivalence class of cauchy sequence of rational numbers
        - infinite sums/infinite nested radicals or fractions being defined similarly (given they are cauchy/have a limit) (give some examples of when these might be interesting to study)
        - Limits of a function, derivative and integrals

2. Fixing Calculus
    - Early motivation for real analysis specifically definitely was to resolve the paradoxes observed in Calculus
    - Defining everything rigorously from scratch and identifying when certain processes work and some don't is absolutely necessary to be able to resolve the paradoxes.
    - Give a load of examples of confusing looking calculus scenarios that require careful obersvation with analysis to be able to resolve them. Naive calculus would run into trouble

### Big questions

- Why do we care about the properties of Real Numbers not shared by the rationals? What do they allow us to do differently?
  - I need very specific non-trivial examples t
  - Assuming that the answer is that we can do calculus, what makes the concepts of calculus important to us?
- When generalizing from reals to metric/topological/functional spaces, what properties of reals are being preserved and what are not?
