## Outline
### Number System (lead up to the definition of real numbers)
- Argument 1: Natural numbers and integers are useful tools to capture the notion of counting/enumeration and ordering
- Argument 2: Rational Numbers are extensions of integers to attempt to capture the notion of measurement
- Argument 3: Unlike Natural Numbers and Integers, rational numbers are dense yet they have gaps between them (i.e) some measurements are impossible to make
- Argument 4: To be able to meaningfully perform geometry/trigonometry/differentiation/integration those numbers need to be defined using a new number system that is an extension of the rationals

### Real Numbers (Finalizing their properties + Limits of sequences)
- Argument 1: Just like rationals, the reals are also an ordered field as expected of our notion of measurement
- Argument 2: Ordered field + LUB completeness gives us a valid list of properties for the real numbers
- Argument 3: Ordered field + Dedekind cuts completenes gives us a valied list of properties for the real numbers
- Argument 4: Ordered field + Cauchy sequence convergence + archimedean property gives us a valid list of properties of the real numbers
- Argument 5: These constructs built using rationals can be used to construct the reals
- Argument 6: Cauchy Sequences give us a way to talk about convergent sequences without talking about what they are converging to 
- Argument 7: Convergent/Cauchy sequences allow us to model continuous behaviour using discrete entitites
- Argument 8: Bounded sequences let us talk about sup/inf of sets of real numbers and eventually the LUB property starting from the cauchy sequence definition of reals
- Argument 9: Extended reals (using +inf and -inf) alonside limit points (limsup, liminf) give us a way to talk about sequences that seem to have convergent behaviour but dont't converge to a real number
- Argument 10: (Argument needs more polish and exploration) Subsequences let us talk about limit points and bolzano-weierstrass theorem
- Argument 11: Exponentiation on real numbers is well defined even if the exponents are real numbers themselves

### Continuous Functions (Continuous Intervals, Functions mapping those intervals, limits of functions)
- Argument 1: 

### Differentiability

### Riemann Integrability
