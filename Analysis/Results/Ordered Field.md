# Ordered Field

On top of being a field with a total order defined for its elements the Reals (as well as Rationals) are also an Ordered Field

***Ordered Field:*** A field $F (F, +, \times)$ with a total ordering $(>)$ is an ordered field such that:
    - $\forall x, y, z \in F y > z \implies x + y > x + z$
    - $\forall x, y \in F x > 0 \cap y > 0 \implies x\times y > 0$

***Proposition (Properties of an Ordered Field):*** For an ordered field $F$ the following are true:
    1. $\forall x \in F x > 0 \implies 0 > (-x)$
    2. $\forall x, y, z \in F x > 0 \cap y > z \implies xy > xz$
    3. $\forall x, y, z \in F 0 > x \cap y > z \implies xy < xz$
    2. $\forall x, y, z \in F y > z \implies xy > xz$
